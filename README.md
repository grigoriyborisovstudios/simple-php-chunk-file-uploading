# Chunk-based PHP file uploading system

Simple PHP uploading system, that splits the file into parts of a given variable, example '1MB' on the clientside with javascript, and on the server side merges it back together to the actual file, and its earlier name when all chunks were uploaded.




## Usage/Examples

Used to bypass upload_max_filesize set in the php config file by server administrators.
